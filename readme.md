# PHP Examples to demonstrate SOLID principles

The best way of understanding the SOLID principles and how they can be used to help you design better code is through your own painful experience.

In an attempt to save you some pain, this repo demonstrates each principle one at a time, from an initial start point that is a functional, albeit limited web shop, through 5 evolutions, that make it much more maintainable, extendable and robust.

At the end you'll see, just how through making some simple design changes at the start, we could have added tonnes more functionality to our little web shop, with modifying any of our original, tested, released code.

## How to use this repo?

Each step has a readme file in it that sets the scene, explains what's been done to improve the code, and tees up the next step with some hypothetical new features that we need to add to our web shop.

Go to the <a href="0_Start/readme.md">0_Start/readme.md</a> to begin the journey. 

## Disclaimer

This code exists only to demonstrate the 5 solid principles and accompanies the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NeilCrookes1/so-solid-fu-designing-better-code">slides</a>.

It isn't meant to be good code, let alone production code. It doesn't even do anything on it's own.

Feel free to point out syntax errors, or issues with things it's attempting to illustrate, the but please don't bother raising issues with it's direct usefulness in real world applications. 

Pull requests welcome.
